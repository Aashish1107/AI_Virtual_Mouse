# AI_Vitual_Mouse
#Personal Project to build a Virtual Mouse using mediapipe

#AI_Virtual_Mouse.py imports HandTrackingMod.py

#So make sure both files are in the same directory

AI_Virtual_Mouse is designed to move and control your mouse without an input device like a mouse but rather uses a live video(Camera is Required to capture images).
It uses inbuilt packages in python3 like Mediapipe, Opencv and PyAutoGUI and hence the executing system would require these to be installed already.

To install openCV, open prompt and type:
pip install opencv-python

To install Mediapipe, open prompt and type:
pip install mediapipe

To install PyAutoGUI, open prompt and type:
pip install pyautogui

After installing the required packages, you can download the required files and use the Virtual_Mouse.
